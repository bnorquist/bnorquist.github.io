This is my blog to record my experiments, learnings, thoughts and experiences 
in self hosting, homelab setup, ai models, file sharing, and general tinkering.
I hope to catelogue the whole process of hosting this blog and 
various services on my homelab in a reproducable way 
as well as explaining what I have learned and how along the way.
